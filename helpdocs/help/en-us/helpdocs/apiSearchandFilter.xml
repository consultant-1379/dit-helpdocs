        All examples on this page are shown as unencoded, where name = 'Cloud3a' is encoded as name+%3d+%27Cloud3a%27.
        Client libraries handle this encoding automatically.

        When using the GET method on the API the results can be searched by adding ?q=&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; to the end of your request.
        Using this you can search the GET to only show results that meet you criteria.
        <b>Example:</b> /api/pods/?q=name=Cloud3a
        This example will only show pods that have the name 'Cloud3a', if no pod is named 'Cloud3a' an empty array is returned.

        Use a.b to search using field b that is nested within field a;
        <b>Example:</b> /api/pods/?q=networks.name=provider_network_3A
        This example will only show pods that have the name a network with the name 'provider_network_3A', if no pod is named 'Cloud3a' an empty array is returned.

      <lines>
        When using the GET method on the API the results can be filtered by adding ?fields=fieldName to the end of your request.
        Using this you can filter the GET to return a partial response.
        <b>Example:</b> /api/pods/?fields=name
        This example will only show the names of all the pods.

        Use a,b to select multiple fields,authUrl
        <b>Example:</b> /api/pods/?fields=name,authUrl
        This example will show the names and authUrls of all the pods.

        Use a/b or a(b) to select a field b that is nested within field a;
        <b>Example:</b> /api/pods/?fields=networks/name or /api/pods/?fields=networks(name)

        These can be used in conjunction with the search above to return a partial response of a specific search.
        <b>Example:</b> /api/projects/?q=pod_id=594aa0abe0138800154d165d&amp;fields=name
        This will return the names of all projects that use the pod with that id.
